Part 1.  
R(n) = -1(1)^n+3(3)^n 
The order of growth is exponential theta(2^n) 
see other file for work. 


Part 2. 
Lucas is also known for the Tower of Hanoi 

Part 3. 
The average ratio for a run with 30 term was 1.63812
1.6180 is the golden ratio 
The order of growth is exponential

Part 4. 
The sum with the greatest number of combinations is 66. 
Which can be created in 1364 different ways. 
The number of combinations are mirrored around 1364 (65 = 1361 and 67 = 1361 etc.)
